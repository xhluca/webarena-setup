# visualwebarena-setup

Setup scripts for visualwebarena.

## Configure

Edit `00_vars.sh` with your ports and hostname (or ip address).

Download the necessary docker images from the [official visualwebarena repo](https://github.com/web-arena-x/visualwebarena/tree/main/environment_docker). You'll need the following files:
- classifieds_docker_compose.zip
- shopping_final_0712.tar
- postmill-populated-exposed-withimg.tar
- wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2022-05.zim

(if you're planning to setup multiple instances, should download these files once in a shared location)

## Configure the scripts

Edit `00_vars.sh` with your ports and hostname (or ip address). You can also change `ARCHIVES_LOCATION="./"` to where your files are if you put them at a different location (like a shared folder).

## Extract / load the image files (very long, do it just once)

Unzip the classifieds docker folder:
```sh
# assuming you cloned and inside visualwebarena/

# only once, do this in the visualwebarena folder
# e.g. /mnt/research/scratch/users/xlu41/webarena/containers/
ln -s /path/to/dir/with/containers containers

cd containers/

# unzip the classifieds docker folder
unzip classifieds_docker_compose.zip
```

Create a wiki folder and move the wikipedia file to it
```sh
# assuming you cloned and inside visualwebarena/
mkdir wiki
ln -s wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2022-05.zim wiki/wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2022-05.zim
```

Load the docker image files
```sh
bash 01_docker_load_images.sh
```

Once these three steps are completed, you can get rid of the downloaded files (or unmount your shared folder) as these won't be needed any more.

## Run the server

Easiest way is to start a tmux or screen session, then run scripts 01 to 06 in order. The last script serves the homepage and should stay up.
```bash
bash 02_docker_remove_containers.sh
bash 03_docker_create_containers.sh
bash 04_docker_start_containers.sh
bash 05_docker_patch_containers.sh
bash 06_serve_homepage.sh
```

Optional: to start the reset server (automated full instance resets) run the following in a side tmux or screen terminal
```bash
bash 07_serve_reset.sh
```

Then you can trigger a full instance reset by accessing `http://${PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}:${RESET_PORT}/reset` check the instance status via `http://${PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}:${RESET_PORT}/reset`.

## Safety check

Go to the homepage and click each link to make sure the websites are operational (some might take ~10 secs to load the first time).

## Reset

After an agent is evaluated on VisualWebArena, a reset is required before another agent can be evaluated.

Run scripts 02 to 06 again, or query the reset URL `http://${PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}:${RESET_PORT}/reset` if the reset server is running.
